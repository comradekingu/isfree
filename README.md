# IsFree
This little script is fundamentally aimed at finding out whether you have installed one or more non-free/libre Arch Linux packages, be it an official or an AUR package. It takes Parabola's blacklists to perform the test. Taking advantage of these 
blacklists, I also added an option to scan your system for privacy threatening software. It's very basic, but it works.
