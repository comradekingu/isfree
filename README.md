# IsFree
> FREELY making your Arch Linux free

This script is mainly intended to find out whether there is some non-free/libre package (both official and from the AUR) in your Arch Linux installation. It uses Parabola's blacklists to perform the tests. Taking advantage of these blacklists, I also added an option to scan the system for privacy threatening software. You can check entire repos or individual packages as well. Come on, give a smile to uncle RMS!

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/leo-arch/isfree

## Execution:

    cd isfree; ./isfree
